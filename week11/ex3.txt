In the first program we get two "Hello" because line buffer is used. That's why when whe printf("\n") called buffer each thread prints "Hello\n".
So we get:
Hello
Hello
In the second case when the fork is done buffer contains nothing, because it gets printed before fork. So when printf("\n") called each thread prints "\n".
So we get:
Hello
