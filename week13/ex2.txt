Deadlock detection
Provides maximum concurrency and resource utilization.
But roll-backs happen, also even if there is no deadlock cycle checking performed.

Deadlock prevention
Is good when rool-backs are too expensive or not impossible
Low resource utilization

Avoidance
no roll-backs
It is required to know resource requirements in advance.
